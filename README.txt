collective.js.anythingslider
============================

Simple integration (just css &amp; js) of Anythingslider in [Plone CMS](http://plone.org).  
[Anythingslider](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider) is very robust jQuery-based slider plugin.

I just putted the js/css stuffs in a "plonish" way and created a Register Profile.
No theme provided.

TO-DO
======
+ Themes
+ Config panel
+ (maybe) PloneTrueGallery integration
